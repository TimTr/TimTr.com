I would like to call out that a lot of the CSS used on this site is modified from a project by [Jenil Gogari on GitHub](https://github.com/jenil/chota) that I expect to continue to modify well into the future. I doubt he'd have any interest in the modifications I make, as I will mostly just be cutting stuff down to the least amount of CSS needed for the site. But his project definitely gave this site a jump start originall. Thanks!
