# ReadMe.md

This is the code for my personal website, [TimTr.com](https://timtr.com) and TimTriemstra.com.


## Overview

So far this code is pretty basic, with a single page of HTML, and one of CSS (located in the `assets` folder). 



## Acknowledgements

The CSS used on this site was originally modified from a project by [Jenil Gogari on GitHub](https://github.com/jenil/chota) that gave this site a jump-start in looking presentable. Thanks for making your work public so others can learn and benefit.
