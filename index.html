<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul class="list-no-bullets">
  <li>🏢 🏡 🏰 <em>Places I have lived.</em>  I was born and grew up within the city of Detroit, near Five Mile Road and the Southfield Freeway. At age twenty-one I moved to Atlanta, and lived there for seven years. Next came San Diego, during which time I would travel among Corvallis, Boulder, and New York City each month. Then in 2005 I moved to the Bay Area, northern-California where I met my wife, Maggie, and we had our daughter, Luana. In 2022 our family moved to the San Diego area where we now reside.</li><br/>
  
  <li>🐕 🐕 <em>Dogs.</em> Maggie and I have had four dogs together, in addition to our childhood pets. We had only Bambi the first few years, a seven-pound pomeranian. He made it to almost seventeen years old, but we lost him a few weeks after moving to San Diego in 2022. We also had Mei Mei, a cavalier spaniel, whom we lost early in the pandemic, after ten years. We currently have JoJo, a border collie we rescued after he had been locked outside and abandoned. He is the friendliest dog alive! And recently we adopted DiDi, a pomeranian mix that needed a new home. JoJo and DiDi seem to really love each other.</li>
